==== Credentials

Credentials are what Ansible Tower uses to connect our automation to everything else. For our lab today we are going to set up 2 kinds of credentials.

===== AWS Credentials (API Keys)

Since this lab is in AWS we need to tell Ansible Tower how to connect. For this we create an AWS Credential. For the AWS information we create a user in IAM and give him the needed permissions.

AWS API Keys have a Access key & Secret key and look like this

[source]
----
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AKISVDRBRTYTRRBYY"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="33afa7rb45ragpkoprovk300e=20evk=0kj9j"
----

To create the new API Key inside Tower go to the following path;

`SETTINGS / CREDENTIALS / CREATE CREDENTIAL`

===== Machine Credentials (SSH Keys)

Ansible uses ssh as the transport method. With that in mind, we need to give Ansible Tower the same ssh key(s) that AWS sets up on the system via cloud-init when it is provisioned. To create the new ssh key to use inside of Tower, copy the contents of the private key into the `PRIVATE KEY` section. Be sure to give information about the key so you can remember what it goes to later on.

[IMPORTANT]
.Don't forget about the Permissions!
====
Every artifact (Credentials, Job Templates, etc.) in Ansible Tower has associated permissions. Be sure to associate them with the correct users and teams so they can see and use/admin them as needed when they log in!

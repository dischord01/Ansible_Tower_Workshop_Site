=== Projects

Projects link your version-controlled playbooks to Ansible Tower. The importance of this concept can't be overstated. Ansible Tower is a tool to make your Ansible Playbooks more scaleable in your enterprise. But you are still writing playbooks just like you would with Ansible core.

[TIP]
While you do write them just like you would with using Ansible core, Tower can make your life easier. We'll point that out along the way in a few places.

==== Lab Playbooks Source Code

The playbooks we will use for all of today's lab are available in a link:https://github.com/bhirsch70/Ansible[public Github repository]. So you can pull them down, replicate this lab, and expand on them as you see fit.

[IMPORTANT]
As always, pull requests are welcome!

=== Inventories

In Ansible Tower, inventories are how you track and group your systems so you can act on them. Our inventory for this lab will be coming from AWS, so we will need to configure Ansible Tower to look for our systems in AWS.

==== Groups

Once an Inventory is created, you are presented with a Group and Hosts screen. For AWS, we want to create a group that will dynamically go out to a given region of AWS (us-west-2 in our case today) and use our Cloud Credential to log in to AWS to pull down information about all of our hosts.

If you were managing inventories around your own datacenter you may want to create hosts individually depending on your source of Inventory. Ansible Tower has many options including CloudForms and Satellite that can be used as data sources.

==== Syncing Cloud Provider Groups

Once our AWS Group was created, we click on the `Start Sync Process` icon on the Inventories screen. This will go out to AWS to pull down updated information. Once that is done we will have hosts populated in that section for our EC2 Inventory.

==== Scheduling Group Syncs

You can also schedule regular sync processes from the Inventories screen. This is good when you have a dynamic cloud environment.

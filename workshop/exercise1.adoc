== Exercise One - Creating EC2 Instances

[IMPORTANT]
Be sure you can log in to {tower_url}. The email you used to register for this workshop should be your username and the password will be shown as part of the lab. If you can't log in start shouting loud and waving your hands!

Now that everyone can log into Ansible Tower (right?!), everyone will be able to create a few EC2 instances to use during our following labs. You should be able to see a job template called `Provision EC2 Job Template`. Click the `launch` button next to it in the `Job Templates` screen.

[TIP]
Can you see the job we used to create all of the user accounts?


=== Playbook Tags

If you look at the link:https://github.com/RedHatGov/Provision_EC2_Instances/blob/master/roles/aws.ec2/tasks/main.yml[playbook role that is being called], you will notice that the tasks have tags associated with them.

.Using Ansible Tags to provision instances
[source]
----
...
- name: create ec2 instance
  ec2:
    keypair: tower
    type: t2.small
    image: ami-b63769a1
    region: us-east-1
    count: 1
    vpc_subnet_id: "{{ vpc_subnet_id }}"
    assign_public_ip: yes
    instance_tags:
      Name: "{{ tower_user_name }}-lab"
      ansible_lab: true
      user_id: "{{ tower_user_name }}"
    wait: true
  register: ec2
  tags:
    - provision # <1>
...
----
<1> provision tag

.Using Ansible Tags to terminate instances
[source]
----
...
- name: Terminate EC2 instances that were previously launched
  ec2:
    state: 'absent'
    region: "us-eas-1"
    instance_ids: '{{ aws_ec2_facts.instances[0].id }}'
  tags:
    - terminate # <2>
...
----

<2> terminate tag

The tags can be referenced in a playbook to limit which tasks in a role are called. It allows you to selectively run parts of roles without lots of messy logic. They are link:http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_tags.html[fully documented].

Inside a Job Template, you can use tags as well. In our EC2 Provisioning Job Template, we are only running tasks in the role that have a `provision` tag.


[TIP]
Job Templates can also prompt for Playbook Tags at launch. Even more ways to be dynamic and not have to repeat yourself!

==== View New AWS EC2 Instance

Click the refresh button on the Inventory page to see the new host.

==== Terminate new instance

Simply change the tag from `provision` to `terminate`.

[IMPORTANT]
Be sure to add your new Team to your new Organization!

==== Notifications

Here is where we can have a little bit of fun. We've created a Slack Team, https://redhat-ansible-lab.slack.com , that everyone here is free to join today. We are going to hook it into Ansible Tower today so we can get important notifications.

This process is link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/notifications.html#slack[documented in the Tower 3.0.1 User Guide]. It involves creating a bot in Slack and hooking his API Key into Tower. It takes about 10 minutes.

==== Credentials

Credentials are what Ansible Tower uses to connect our automation to everything else. For our lab today we are going to set up 2 kinds of credentials.

===== AWS Credentials

Since this lab is in AWS we need to tell Ansible Tower how to connect. For this we create an AWS Credential. For the AWS information we create a user in IAM and give him the needed permissions. That information is available in the link:https://aws.amazon.com/iam/faqs/[IAM Documentation].

===== Machine Credentials

Ansible uses ssh as the transport method. With that in mind, we need to give Ansible Tower the same ssh key(s) that AWS sets up on the system via cloud-init when it is provisioned.

[IMPORTANT]
.Don't forget about the Permissions!
====
Every artifact (Credentials, Job Templates, etc.) in Ansible Tower has associated permissions. Be sure to associate them with the correct users and teams so they can see and use/admin them as needed when they log in!

==== Last Word About Settings

When you have all of the information handy, like your SSH keys, Slack API Token, etc. the above works takes around 15-20 minutes to configure.

This can all also happen through the API or the command line using tower-cli on the Tower server or a remote server connecting back to the Tower server.

=== Job Templates

This is where the rubber meets the road. A job template combines all of the things we just set up

* machine credentials
* cloud credentials
* playbooks from your project's source SCM
* inventories

and puts them all together to provide a platform for effectively managing your infrastructure. Job Templates also have the ability to limit which hosts are acted on in multiple ways and configure all of the 'normal' Ansible things like whether or not a job is run with privilege escalation.

To create a new JOB TEMPLATE inside Tower go to the following path;

`JOB TEMPLATES / CREATE JOB TEMPLATE`

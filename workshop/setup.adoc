== Setup

== Ansible Tower

=== Infrastructure

For this lab, we will be using Ansible Tower 3.0.2, which is the latest production release. We are running it in an link:https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/[`m4.xlarge`] AWS instance.

[NOTE]
.We know this is resource overkill
====
But we'll only be running this for a few days and our bosses are paying the bill. :)
====


This lab is NOT a walkthrough of Ansible Tower's setup. To be honest, it's too simple.

==== Steps to setup Ansible Tower

* get a system of correct size
* register it with Red Hat
* subscribe it to the proper channels
* download a tarball containing the Ansible setup scripts
* fill a few variables out in an inventory file
* Run ansible playbook


=== End Result

The Ansible Tower we set up for this lab is at {tower_url}

=== First Login

You know you were successful if you are able to browse to your Tower's hostname and get some like

To log in, you use the admin password you set in your inventory file. It's just that easy!

[IMPORTANT]
Students will use the `student` + the number you were assigned for `USERNAME` + `PASSWORD`

.Example
[source]
----
USERNAME: student1
PASSWORD: student1

== The Tower UI

In order to save a fair amount of time during this lab we have built out several of the constructs that Tower uses to organize itself into a enterprise, multi-tenant deployment tool. Instead of doing those live, we will walk through them quickly here so we can get to the good stuff sooner.

=== Settings

The `settings` menu (the little gear in the top right corner) is where you do a lot of your initial work to configure Ansible Tower. Within it are 8 options (9 if you include 'About')

We won't need to cover them all, but a few are key for us to be able to effectively use Tower today.
